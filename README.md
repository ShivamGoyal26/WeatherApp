# weatherApp

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Here there, So this is the weather app which i have made again in the flutter. <br>
Here i tried to make the UI as simple as Possible... <br>

## Features

Here you can basically query the weather and temperature of metro cities. <br>
This app will show you the weather forecast of 7 Days ahead. <br>
Here you can also get the current location of yourself by taping at the very top-right corner. <br>
Here you can find the precise information such as <br>
country, <br>
country-code, <br>
postal-code, <br>
Area,<br>
etc about any area, town, city, etc by just entering the coordinates of that! <br>

## What i have used:

Here i have used the weather API know as meta weather<br>
https://www.metaweather.com/api/ <br>
I have used the state-management concept in this project (PROVIDER PACKAGE) <br>
Here i am using the main two flutter package which is: <br>
1. geolocator <br>
2. geocoder <br>
